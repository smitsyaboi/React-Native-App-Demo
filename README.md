# React-Native-App-Demo
Team Resource for React Native App using Expo Go. This application allows a user to enter personal information including their name, address, and phone number, and take a selfie using their device's camera. It demonstrates basic form handling, navigation between different views within a single-screen app, and integration with native device features like the camera.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
- npm (which comes with Node.js)
- [Expo CLI](https://expo.dev/) (for managing the React Native environment)
- An IDE or text editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Atom)
- An iOS or Android device or emulator for testing

- You can refer to the [React Native Quick Guide](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/react_native/react_native_quick_guide.htm) for help getting started. 

### Setting Up the Development Environment
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:smitsyaboi/React-Native-App-Demo.git
   cd MyReactNative

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
3. **Start the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm start

This will start the Expo development server and open a message in your console with a QR code using the Expo Go app.

## Running the app
**On a Physical Device**
  Install the Expo Go app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android).
  Scan the QR code displayed in the browser with your device. The app should start running on your device.

## Additional Notes
Ensure camera permissions are granted for the app to function properly. The app will request permissions upon attempting to take a selfie.
